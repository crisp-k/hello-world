# hello-world
First repository

Hello, I am an aspiring developer.
This is my first repository on GitHub, and
I hope to use this platform to host projects
so future employers may see my body of work.


# Hello, Now,
An update 4 years later (02/16/2023)

Hello, I am closer than I was to being an aspiring developer.
A lot has changed over the course of 4 years. I wish that I had written more about what I was going through, what I was feeling, what exactly carried me through this journey of coding, programming, and developing. 

Am I a developer? Officially, no, not at all. I'm hardly much of anything, but that isn't quite true. I am a lot now, in fact:
  - I code with a personal style (who knows why that is the first thing I think of), but can adhere to style requirements (for prospective employers). 
  - I am smarter than I ever thought (I fell in love with mathematics, and practiced Calc 1 problems like mad back in the day), and I have found such a wide bredth of challenges that have been more than fulfilling. 
  - I was one of the lucky students, I believe. I had fantastic professors, and had a hunger to master a good deal of material. 
  - Some later courses in my degree proved challenging, specifically the courses centered around Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and even some Statistics, at least in some ways. Ironic, that those are the parts of the field that I wish to work within full-time some day. That I even wish to perform research in.
  - A developer that created his _own_ Genetic Algorithm implementation (no, it currently does not coverge properly, but the algorithm itself works).
  - ...and so on... (yes this is a cop out for now, forgive me, it is 2:24AM)
  
  
Point being, I have discovered humanity.

I have found a deep love for people, for science, for learning and the application of self.

I have been met with tragedy, dissapointment, struggle. Failure, and lessons with them.

I have let myself down. I have faced addiction, and have been hurt deeply.

I have learned to find love in the work, to ask questions that drive me forward.

I have proven myself capable. I know how to google (a trait more rare than you might think).

I have a girl I wish to marry, and a heart full of fear.

I... love algorithms, I love computer science, I love the pursuit of real science, and I love creativity.

I love the shimmer of leaves in a tree, and a hot coffee on a cold winter's day.

I love to write, I love to sing, I love to play guitar.

I love watching my girlfriend do anything skillful, or filled with challenges, I love listening to her thoughts about anything, I love her eyes. I love her soul.

Anyways, it's late. Future crisp-k, I know you will have done great things in your free time. I hope that you continue to set aside the time you are attemtping to set aside now. It will forever pay off, both for your intrapersonal relationships, as well as your relationship with yourself. Never forget, you will always be by your side. Take care of yourself, develop gratitude. Remember your own self.

Remember that you are human, and that coding, programming, and developing, is simply an extension of your very own self.
